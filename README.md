# PredictingWeather
In this project, we'll predict the weather using machine learning.

We'll be working with weather data from a station at the Oakland International Airport. The data is from 1960 through 2021. Each row in the data represents one day, and the columns represent different weather measurements. The data is in a file called local_weather.csv.
